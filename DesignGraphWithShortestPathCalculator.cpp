Intuition:

Hi there, ðŸ˜„

Let's diveðŸ¤¿ deep into our today's problem.

The problem requires implementing a class `Graph` to represent a directed weighted graph and providing methods to initialize the graph, add edges,
and find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular
algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

*/

/*

**Algorithm:**
1. The `Graph` class is initialized with a given number of nodes `n` and a list of edges `edges`. The edges are stored in an adjacency list representation using an unordered map.
2. The `addEdge` method is used to add a new edge to the graph. The edge information is added to the adjacency list.
3. The `shortestPath` method calculates the shortest path between two given nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. It returns the minimum cost of the path.
4. The `dijkstra` method performs Dijkstra's algorithm. It maintains a priority queue to process nodes with the smallest tentative distance first. The algorithm continues until all nodes are processed or the destination node is reached.
5. The tentative distance to each node is updated if a shorter path is found.
6. If the destination node is reached, the minimum cost to reach it is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned, indicating that there is no path.

Learning:
- Dijkstra's algorithm is a versatile algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- Priority queues are useful for efficiently selecting nodes with the smallest tentative distances during the algorithm's 
  execution.
- Properly updating distances and using suitable data structures for graph representation are crucial for the efficiency
  of the algorithm.

Complexity
Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O((V + E) * log(V)), where V is the number of nodes and E
  is the number of edges.
- Each edge is processed once, and the priority queue operations take O(log(V)) time.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.
- The adjacency list representation requires O(V + E) space, and additional space is used for the priority queue and distance array.
